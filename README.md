# AngularJS Webpack

First of all, this is a work in progress. 

I am using here AngularJS setup up with Webpack and Babel, to use ES6 classes.

The main idea here is to explore the possibilites that a flexible environment like AngularJS can give, while working with the "latest"ES6 features and with Webpack 4.
